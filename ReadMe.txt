Semester Project Details :
This app is for student benefits. They have to use their RED IDs as login ID and password. Authorised users will get the list of courses they are enrolled in. When they click on any courses, assignments and exams due date will be displayed.
Assignments and exams will also have downloadable file which will be stored in internal storage of device when downloaded.
Assignments and exams list will also have contextual menu which will help them to set reminder and SMS partner if they have any.

App supports both English and Spanish languages.

I have used Parse for students database.
This app works only if the Device have internet connection.

Problem with app : I am checking for Partner Required (Parse data) for assignments on Item long click. This is making the context menu to appear slow for the assignments that need partner. SMS partner options will appear after delay of a second.

ID and password needs to be used to test the app :ID and password are same
